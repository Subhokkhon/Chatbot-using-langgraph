Chatbot using LangGraph

This project demonstrates how to build an intelligent chatbot using LangGraph, a framework for building stateful AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot can handle conversational flows, maintain context, and be extended with custom logic for real-world applications.

🚀 Features

Built using LangGraph for structured conversation management.

Integrates LLMs for natural language understanding and response generation.

Supports multi-turn conversations with memory and context handling.

Modular and extensible design – easy to add custom nodes, tools, and workflows.

Implemented in a Google Colab Notebook for step-by-step understanding and experimentation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Groq API

Langsmith API

📖 How It Works

Define the conversation workflow using LangGraph nodes.

Connect nodes to model chatbot flow (e.g., user input → processing → LLM response).

Run the chatbot in an interactive environment.
